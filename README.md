# Financial Investment Advisor LLM

A production-grade fine-tuned language model for institutional investment decision support.

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

**Problem:** Institutional investors struggle to synthesize investment insights from unstructured financial data (earnings calls, SEC filings, analyst reports). Current LLMs are generalist models, not optimized for financial domain reasoning.

**Solution:** Fine-tuned Phi-3.5-mini on 50K high-quality financial instructions to create a domain-specific AI advisor that provides expert-level investment analysis.
